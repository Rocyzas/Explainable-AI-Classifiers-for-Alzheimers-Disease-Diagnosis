SheffieldProspective_Neuro.csv - Neurocognitive test scores for each patient

MMSE = Mini-Mental State Exam (most common test used to diagnose AD)

- max 30 points
- score of 22 points or fewer (adjusted by education) indicates memory concerns

CDR = Clinical Dementia Rating (clinical evaluation of the level of dementia)

- 0 = absent; 0.5 = questionable; 1= present, but mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = profound; 5 = terminal

SheffieldProspective_sMRI.csv (MRI-derived volume of different brain regions)

Alzheimer's disease causes neurodegeneration that can be observed as volume 
loss in certain regions of the gray matter (but not in others). These regions
were delineated from the MR images and the volumes of each region (144 in 
total) are reported here.

For explanation of what the regions are, consult an anatomical brain atlas.

SheffieldProspective_ASL.csv (MRI-derived mean perfusion values different brain regions)

In early stages of Alzheimer's disease, variations of blood flow (perfusion)
in the brain have been reported. Using a non-invase MR imaging modality called
ASL (arterial spin labelling), the blood in different parts of the brain can
be measured in ml/min/100g of tissue. 

These regions were delineated from the MR images and the mean blood flow values
in each region (141 in total) are reported here.

For explanation of what the regions are, consult an anatomical brain atlas.
