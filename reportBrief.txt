	Overview(Structure of the report)
	Terminology
	phase1
		aims, objectives, deliverables
	phase2
		aims, objectives, deliverables
	relevance to degree
	
Planning and Methodology - 2 p (how I solved the problem)
	Time PLan(Expected (initial plan), Actual (amended plan))
	Risk and Mitigation(Precaution table)
		Data availability
		Model Training/Testing time
	Issues
		Legal issues
		Ethical and social issues
		professional issues

	biology background - 1p
		Hippocampus (anatomy, function, how AD affects it, prevention-treatments)
		Alzheimer's - 1p
	Dataset (briefly)

	Explainability
		LIME
		ELI5
		Feature importance (say that they might be not considered as explanations,
			but rather an indication of weights)
		
	Previous Studies - 1/2p

Experiments, Software Implementation - 11 p (how I implemented it and how I will test if it works)
	Phase1
		Methodology/Design
			System/libs requirements 
			Which method was used for implementing it
			Requirements Gathering
			idea how it should work for user
			Add UML or something
		Data Preparation
			ADNI + Sheffield
		Implementation of Classifiers
			Hyperparameters(BayessearchCV)(regularisation)
			All ML models implemented
			Optimisation
		Explainability
			LIME
			ELI5
			Feature importance
	Phase2
		Methodology/Design
			System/libs requirements (python version, virt env, pip)
			Which method was used for implementing it
			idea how it should work for user
			Add UML or something
		Data Preparation
			ADNI 1.5T Screening PreProcessed images
			How it got processed
		Implementation of Classifiers
			Hyperparams
			ANN
			CNN
	Testing
		Unit tests
		Synthetic dataset(for both phases)
		Manual testing
		Checking model accuracy
		All libraries are open source and well tested

Evaluation, results - 10 p (how did it work in practise)
	Explain what each metric represents
	I need big recall! explain why? because I need FP>FN(or smth)
	Each Model Metrics Table(Accuaracy, Recall, f-score, precision, conf matrix, ROC/AUC, MCC)
	Plot diagrams(maybe into results section)
		using different feature sets
	Compare results to prev studies? (short comparison, ,because background should be done above)
	Compare binary classification and multi class
	Observations

Conclusion and Future work (with legal and ethical issues) - 3 p (did I achieve my goals and what could be done next)
1(What was observed) 2(What did I learn and what would I have done differently)
	Flaws?
	Possible Extentions(for others)
	Conculsion
	Future treatments of alzheimers (alphafold)
	
Self Appraisal - 1 p

Scattered ideas:
effort - passion, challenges
method - how is this CS related
achievement - results, eveluation
